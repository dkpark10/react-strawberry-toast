<br />
Basic toast can be customized in the form of a function. Basic style and animation are applied. If you don't want this, use **toast.custom**
<br />

```jsx
toast(
  ({ close }) => (
    <div className="bg-white p-2 flex justify-between gap-2 rounded-sm">
      <span>tailwind css toast</span>
      <button type="button" className="bg-red-500 text-white w-6 h-6 rounded-sm" onClick={close}>
        X
      </button>
    </div>
  )
);
```

<br />

### close function

Toast disappears **3000ms** after mounting and is completely removed from the toast list after **200ms**. This was intentionally removed after 200 ms for animation application when unmounted. If you want to remove it immediately, use **immediatelyClose** props function.

<br />

```jsx
toast(({ immediatelyClose }) => <div onClick={immediatelyClose}>...</div>)
```

<br />

### icons

Icons for success, error, warn, and loading states are available as props.

<br />

```jsx
toast(({ icons }) => <div>{icons.success}</div>)
```

<br />

## toast.custom

The main difference from a **toast()** is that when using a **toast.custom()**, all default animations and styles are removed, allowing for more flexible customization
